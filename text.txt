Continue WellNoosh React Native app development - Step 5

We completed Step 4: Added swipe gestures to LandingScreen + working AuthModal with login/signup functionality.

Current status:
✅ LandingScreen with swipe navigation (5 slides)
✅ AuthModal with forms, validation, Google auth placeholder
✅ App.tsx handles authentication state
✅ React Native/Expo setup working perfectly

Current structure:
- V2/src/screens/LandingScreen.tsx (with swipe gestures)
- V2/src/components/AuthModal.tsx (full login/signup)
- V2/App.tsx (navigation + auth state)
- V2/assets/ (Expo assets)

Next Step 5: Add OnboardingFlow after successful authentication
- Convert OnboardingFlow.tsx from Figma files to React Native
- Add diet preferences, allergies, medical conditions screens
- Connect to authentication flow
- Add progress tracking and navigation

Ready to implement post-authentication onboarding experience.
