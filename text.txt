✅ Authentication State: User login/signup flow working

Step 5: OnboardingFlow (JUST COMPLETED)

✅ Data Collection: Captures user preferences, health info, family setup
✅ Progress Tracking: Step counter and progress bar
✅ Validation: Required fields and flow control
✅ Clean Logging: Only final data logged, no keystroke logs
✅ No Success Popups: Smooth flow without interruptions
✅ Personalized Welcome: Shows "WellNoosh [UserName]"

NEXT STEP: Step 6 - Main App Dashboard
After onboarding completion, users currently see a placeholder completion screen. We need to implement:
Main Dashboard Features Needed:

Bottom Tab Navigation (7 tabs: Home, AI Chef, Scan, Schedule, Analysis, Shop, Profile)
Dashboard Screen with:

Welcome header with user's name
Personalized meal recommendations (3 cards)
Quick action tiles (AI Chef, Leftover Handler, Meal Scheduler, Grocery Store)
Quick stats preview (waste reduction, health score, etc.)


Placeholder Screens for each tab section
Modal Interfaces for AI chat and feature interactions

1- after clicking on start your free Trial this message appear: signup signup button pressed! . I dont want to recive this kind of messages. also after signing up the Success! Welcome Mohammad Peyman appear I dont want to have it. 
2- in Welcoming page only the name should appear not first name and surname. some thing like : WellNoosh Mohammad
3-i have some concern please help me in it.
do you think is it good before creating the main app dashboard is a good idea to create the backend of the things we created? because my main dashboard use the AI agent to get the information of the user and recomment¡d to them. so how we can manage it.


to run : npx expo start --clear --tunnel
