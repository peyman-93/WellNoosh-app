# WellNoosh React Native App - Continuation

I'm building a React Native nutrition app called WellNoosh with Expo. Here's the current status:

## CURRENT STATUS:
✅ Landing page working (Figma design implemented)
✅ Sign Up/Sign In screens working with navigation
✅ Onboarding flow: Welcome → Diet Preferences → Allergies → (Need to complete remaining screens)
✅ Google OAuth setup (needs Google Cloud configuration)
✅ Expo setup complete with tunnel mode

## TECH STACK:
- React Native with Expo
- TypeScript
- @react-navigation/native + @react-navigation/stack
- expo-linear-gradient
- Running with: npx expo start --tunnel

## CURRENT WORKING FLOW:
1. 🍏 Landing Page → "Start Free Trial"
2. 📝 Sign Up Form → Fill details → "Create Account"
3. ✅ Success Alert → "Continue"
4. 👋 Onboarding Welcome → "Let's Personalize Your Experience" → "Continue"
5. 🥗 Diet Preferences → Select diet type → "Continue"
6. ⚠️ Allergies → Select allergies → "Continue" (Working with alerts)

## WHAT I NEED HELP WITH:
1. Complete the remaining onboarding screens (Medical Conditions, Family Setup, Personalization)
2. Fix navigation flow to main app after onboarding
3. Implement the main dashboard and tab navigation
4. Convert Figma-generated components to React Native equivalents

## KEY FILES TO INCLUDE:
1. App.tsx (main navigation setup)
2. Current onboarding screens (OnboardingWelcomeScreen.tsx, DietPreferencesScreen.tsx, AllergiesScreen.tsx)
3. Auth screens (SignUpScreen.tsx, SignInScreen.tsx, LandingScreen.tsx)
4. Google auth files (GoogleAuthService.ts, useGoogleAuth.ts)
5. Any specific error messages or issues I'm facing

Please help me continue building this app with the same structure and design patterns.
