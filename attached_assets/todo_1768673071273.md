## 🍽️ Serving Size Logic (Priority: High)

### Task 1: Default serving = 1 everywhere
- **Affected areas:** Recommendation cards, My Recipes, personalized meals
- **Behavior:** 
  - Default serving size should be 1 (not any other number)
  - User can increase/decrease servings
  - Ingredients scale proportionally with serving count

### Task 2: Fix ingredient units display
- **Location:** My Recipes → Liked recipes → Personalized meal view
- **Problem:** Ingredients show raw numbers without units (e.g., "Bread: 8" — 8 what?)
- **Fix:** Display proper units: `g`, `ml`, `tsp`, `tbsp`, `cups`, `pieces`, etc.
- **Example:** "Turkey Bacon: 50g" not "Turkey Bacon: 50"

### Task 3: Fix Cal/serving calculation
- **Location:** My Recipes → Liked recipes → Personalized view
- **Issue:** Cal/serving info is incorrect after personalization

## 🧹 UI Cleanup (Remove Elements)

| Remove | Location |
|--------|----------|
| "Nutrition per serving" text | Recommendation cards |
| Pantry option | Entire app |
| Health Tracker | Navigation/Home |
| Log your meal | Navigation/Home |

---

## 📊 Nutrition Wheel (Home Screen)

### Task: Simplify nutrition display
- **Keep only:** Calories, Protein, Fiber, Carbs, Fat
- **Remove:** All other nutrition metrics
- **Remove maximums:** Don't show "/2000" for calories — just show consumed amount

---

## 📅 Meal Planner Bug Fix

### Task: Calendar date mismatch
- **Problem:** User selects "1 day" → shows today's date in chat → adds to calendar on NEXT day
- **Fix:** Selected date and calendar date must match
- **Suggestion:** Let user explicitly select the date/time window

---

## 🧘 Breathing Exercise Bug Fix

### Task: Fix countdown sequence
- **Current (wrong):** "Breathe in 3, 2, 1" → "Breathe in 7, 6, 5..."
- **Expected:** "Starting in 3, 2, 1" → "Breathe in 7, 6, 5..."
